Here is a simple site that i did using basic sintaxes of HTML and CSS, in this first version i only did the main page, but i will do the others too to practice, the site have some links to other pages, some news(fake of course) using Lorem ispum in the texts, also some recent post using floating elements to separate them from the Main news, this site is just a basic site, but with time i plan on doing some upgrades and add some other features as i progress in my studies
